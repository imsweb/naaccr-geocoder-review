- input page: add more content on the bottom half, maybe help about using the online NAACCR Geocoder?
- calculating number of lines could be pretty slow, we need to deal with that gracefully in the GUI.
- output page: clean up the Fields Mapping table, use some background colors, etc...
- [DONE] process page: the "Next" and "Skip" buttons are too close to each other; maybe use a checkbox to allow coming back to this line later...
- at the end of the process, there should be summary page with how many addresses changed, how many skipped, etc...
- (bug) when the app is resized, the horizontal scroll is not properly shown in the process page
- (future) process page: allow the user to see the full parsed address.
- (future) need to save the session and allow the user to interrupt a processing, need to show a popup asking "save session" or "discard"
- (future) need to detect if a session file is present, and if it is ask if it should be open
- (future) do we need to support any shortcut?
